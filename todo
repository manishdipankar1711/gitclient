TechScan - Frontend

[Problem Statement]

Develop a Frontend Web Application for TechScan.

TechScan is basically the source code version control info domain of Cast software. All the repos, users and their commits can be viewed in TechScan.

[Ideal Behaviour]

On Front End:

— Get all the relevant data from the provided APIs.

— Your web app should have 3 components which should drill down to in-detail about a particular technology.

— Screen 1: Should categorize TechScan as per Technologies (JavaScript, Java, Python, Php, Ruby)

— Screen 2: Should list the top 9 repo’s as per the technology user selected

Should have search and filter option for repo’s.
Should display 9 repo’s at a time and there should be pagination for the next set of repo’s to display
— Screen 3: Should display details about the repo owner that was selected by the user in screen2, if that owner has multiple repos, it should list that too.

— Implement Pagination and Search on the backend.

[Plus Point]

— Perform QA testing using the following applications

--Chai

--Mocha

--Jasmin

--karma

— Documented, well structured beautified code.

[Extra Work]

— Custom elegant design, fonts and icons to make web app more user-friendly.

— You may add portfolio activity comprising awesome work you have done on web applications.

— Use your imagination and add features which would make things easier for end users.

Note: If you complete any or all of the above-mentioned levels please do submit.
